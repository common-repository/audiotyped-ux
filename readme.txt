With AudioTyped UX you can make design settings for your UX Interview Layout Transcripts.


== Description ==

Many podcast interview transcripts on blog posts are hidden and only visible, if you click a transcript link.
Unfortunaltely the only right to exist for some transcripts on websites are for better traffic from search engines.
The UX Interview Layouts should stop the shadowing existence of online transcripts. In the first place the 
transcripts exist for the user, particularly for the deaf-and-dumb users.


== Installation ==

= Local installation =
1. Upload the `/audiotyped-ux/` folder and its contents to your wordpress plugin directory /wp-content/plugins/
2. Login to your WordPress installation and activate the plugin on the wordpress plugin page


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=For which podcast transcripts I can make the settings?=

The settings are for interview transcripts with 2 speakers

=Nothing happens, when I make settings, what's wrong?=

Probably the transcript is not coded in the UX Interview Layout.
Your interview transcript has to be coded in a specific HTML for the UX Interview Layout.
Soon there will be a documentation with examples.

=Is the UX layout still good for SEO?=

Yes, because it's pure HTML Code, the content is crawlable for Google, Bing or other search engines
